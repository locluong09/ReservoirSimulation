# 2D Reservoir Simulation

## Overview
This mini project simulates fluid flow in a two-dimensional reservoir, allowing for the analysis of different fluid contents, including single phase oil, single phase water, single phase gas, and a traditional multi-phase black oil reservoir (oil, gas, water). The simulation models the dynamics of fluid movement and interaction within a porous medium, solving the governing equation implicitly.
## Implementations
Each cases, there are several implementations in Python, Matlab, Julia, and C++.

## Features
- **2D Fluid Flow Simulation**: Models the movement of fluids in a two-dimensional reservoir.
- **Multiple Fluid Types**: Supports simulation of different fluid contents, including:
  - Water
  - Oil
  - Gas
- **Reservoir Properties**: Support heterogeneous reservoir properties such as permeability, porosity, and fluid viscosities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (optional for advanced calculations)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/locluong09/ReservoirSimulation
